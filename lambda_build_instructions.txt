1. install docker for mac
    https://www.docker.com/docker-mac

2. Run the following command:
    `docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/var/task lambci/lambda:build-python3.6 bash`

    That command starts an interactive (-it) docker container that mirrors the execution environment of the lambda function. Additionally, it has a bind mount of your current working direcotry in /var/task, the directory that you will get dropped into in the container.

3. On the docker container, run `/scripts/package-lambda-function.sh`. This is a shell script which takes in the python files you want to package, spins up a virtual environment for python 3.6, pip installs the python-connector, and packages it all together. It outputs file.zip, where file is the name of the first python file you passed in as an argument.  

    * To build the Alert Handler, use the following command: `./scripts/package-lambda-function.sh alert_handler.py plugins jira`
    * To build the Query Wrapper, use the following command: `./scripts/package-lambda-function.sh query_wrapper.py`
    * To build the Query Executor, use the following command: `./scripts/package-lambda-function.sh query_runner.py`
    * To build the Suppression Wrapper, use the following command: `./scripts/package-lambda-function.sh suppression_wrapper.py`
    * To build the Suppression Executor, use the following command: `./scripts/package-lambda-function.sh suppression_runner.py`

4. Upload the zip to Lambda either through S3 or through the console, invoke your function, and note that you have successfully imported the Snowflake connector.
