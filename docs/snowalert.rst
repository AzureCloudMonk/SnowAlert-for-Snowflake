SnowAlert - Snowflake Security Analytics
****************************************


SnowAlert is a security analytics framework that uses the Snowflake data warehouse for identifying security incidents across diverse data sources and time ranges.


Overview
========

As Snowflake's security team, we need to know quickly and reliably when we're under attack. We use the Snowflake data warehouse to store system, network and application logs and we analyze those logs for indications of active threats. Some very large enterprise teams have developed in-house security analytics solutions on top of Snowflake but we want to make it easier for any team to use Snowflake for its security analytics. That's where SnowAlert comes in.

SnowAlert is a system for running scheduled queries on machine data in Snowflake and then using the query results to drive action at the security team. We built it to be easy to use and extend, without any servers required and Snowflake as the only datastore.
